## songs-utf8 and songs-utf8mb3.sql
Those are the sql files I use when I'm playing BlindMeter (they should be up-to-date, as I upload them each time I do a backup). The utf8-mb3 version should work for the latest versions, if it doesn't work try the utf8 version. Btw, don't judge the musics there are in this files plz.

## example.env
This file is the config file used by the program to get the main settings. It is named .env by default, so you'll need to rename it, otherwise the program won't work (the .env file is directly located in the www file in the wamp directory). The default values should work fine if you follow the tutorial correctly, although you can change the values **at your own risks**.
